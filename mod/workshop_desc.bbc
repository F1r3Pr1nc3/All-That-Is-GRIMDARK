[b]PLAY ADVICE[/b]
Edit each GRIMDARK predefined empire in order to create a clone of it (or you can just copy 'aagrim_prescripted_countries.txt' file at once to your [URL=//stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Modding#Mod_folder_location]game data path[/URL]). [URL=//twitter.com/StellarisGame/status/1015540504845484032]Force spawn[/URL] each of those, pick one to play, set number of opposing AI empires to 12, enjoy.

If vanilla predefined empires are spawning, grab a mod that removes them (e.g. [URL=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2719749769]Remove Paradox Empires[/URL]).
