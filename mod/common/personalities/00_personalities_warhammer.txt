##### Behaviours:
# Conqueror -> Will they conquer planets from other empires?
# Subjugator -> Will they vassalise other empires?
# Liberator -> Will they liberate conquered empires?
# Opportunist -> Are they more likely to attack someone already embroiled in war?
# Uplifter -> Will they uplift and enlighten other species?
# Infiltrator -> Will they infiltrate primitives?
# Dominator -> Will they invade primitives?
# Slaver -> Will they enslave pops?
# Purger -> Will they purge alien pops?
# robot_exploiter -> Will they use robots for menial labor?
# robot_liberator -> Will they give rights to robots?
# Propagator -> Will they only get aggressive once boxed in?
# Multispecies -> Will they give rights to aliens?
# species_mod_priority = {}		define weights for how much the AI should try to modify a given species (root=country, this=species)
# crisis_leader -> Will they fight the crisis and invite others to do so (Fallen Empires special behviour. Emperor/Custodian will behave the same way regardless of this flag.)
# crisis_fighter -> Will they consider fighting the crisis? (If 'no' they will only care about themselves.)
# sneak_attacker -> Will they use cloaked fleets to attack their enemies?

##### Modifiers:
# Aggressiveness -> Affects chance of declaring wars, chance of sending insults, and how much % of fleet power is committed to offense (at 0, 50% is committed, at 1 it is more like 75%, at 2 it is 100%; higher values still count extra towards war dec and insult chance)
# trade_willingness -> At 1.0 willingness they will accept a deal that is equally good for both sides
# Bravery -> Affects the chance that they will pick rivals & war targets of similar strength instead of picking on the weak
# military_spending -> Affects mineral & energy budget that goes to navies and armies
# colony_spending -> Affects mineral & energy budget that goes to new colonies
# threat_modifier -> Affects how much threat is generated for this empire when others are conquered
# threat_others_modifier -> Afffects how much threat is generated for other empires when this empire is conquered
# friction_modifier -> Affects border friction
# claims_modifier -> Affects opinion penalty from claims

# Ships
# armor_ratio -> Amount of armor they should aim for on ships
# shields_ratio -> Amount of shields they should aim for on ships
# hull_ratio -> Amount of hull boosters they should aim for on ships (if available)
# ship_roles: List of "<ship_size> = <role>" statements; AI will use the corresponding role for that size
#  Example:
#  ship_roles = {
#	destroyer = gunship
#  }

##### Diplomacy:
# federation_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form/join a federation
# nap_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a non-aggression pact
# commercial_pact_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a commercial pact
# research_agreement_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a research agreement
# migration_pact_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a migration pact
# defensive_pact_acceptance -> Added directly to chance of accepting to form a defensive pact
# loyalty_acceptance -> As overlord, multiplied by subject loyalty change and added to acceptance of a deal; Low values mean we don't care if subjects are loyal or not, high means we like loyal subjects

##### Diplomacy:
# advanced_start_chance -> Likelyhood of this empire being an advanced start (higher = better chance of being one of empires selected for advanced start)
