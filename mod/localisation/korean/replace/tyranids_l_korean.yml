 CAPTURE_QUEEN_DESC: "After a recent space battle in the [queen_system.GetName] system, a Tyranid Queen was badly injured and left for dead by the rest of the Scourge. The creature is still alive, however. Capturing it would be a major intelligence coup."
 CRISIS_TYPE_PRETHORYN: "Tyranid Scourge"
 SWARM_STRIKE_CRAFT_1_DESC: "Cloned, miniaturized Tyranid specimen can be controlled through wavelengths close to those we use for intra-fleet communication, allowing us to use them as effective strike craft."
 col_infested_desc: "This planet has been infested by the Tyranid Scourge."
 crisis.105.desc: "The [Root.GetName] has managed to heal the worst of the Tyranid Queen's injuries. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] removed the organ responsible for the creature's subspace connection with the rest of the Scourge, and replaced it with a small positronic implant that gives us control over it.\n\nWe can now order the Queen around, and it has already started breeding new Tyranid creatures that are loyal to it, and thus, by extension, us. As long as we can keep the Queen alive, we should be able to grow a fleet of domesticated Tyranid creatures!"
 crisis.107.desc: "Someone else has captured the injured Tyranid Queen that was discovered in the [queen_system_1.GetName] system! The creature has not only been fully healed, but its connection to the rest of the Scourge has been severed. It now serves its new masters, and reports suggest that it has already started a new brood."
 crisis.121.desc: "Many Tyranid creatures remain unaccounted for after the defeat of the Scourge, having slipped away into the depths of space in the ensuing chaos. With no central hive consciousness to guide them, most of these mindless beasts will eventually wither and perish.\n\nHowever, recent sightings have confirmed that a large number of these feral Tyranid have established a new lair in the §H[feral_prethoryn_system.GetName]§! system.\n\nIn the coming years, we will likely face the possibility of more feral Tyranid nesting in unoccupied systems where the Scourge once had a presence. They are unlikely to develop into a major threat - these wild creatures are prone to infighting and do not exhibit the calculating intelligence that drove the Scourge onwards."
 crisis.121.name: "Feral Tyranid Sighted"
 crisis.211.desc: "The galaxy breathed a collective sigh of relief today, as the last significant pockets of the Tyranid Scourge were expunged. Their extragalactic invasion has failed, and all that remains of the Tyranid's once colossal swarm are the innumerable charred husks that now drift quietly through the void.\n\nA sense of elation and utter joy is spreading across the galaxy at a speed greater than light, and spontaneous victory celebrations have erupted on countless worlds. Could this be the beginning of a new age of galactic peace and stability?"
 crisis.234.desc: "Over the last few months, the Tyranid Queen we captured has appeared increasingly restless and uneasy. At first, we thought it was simply missing its connection with the rest of its kind, until our telepaths told us that it had been in communication with them, speaking of a 'Hole in the Void'.\n\nWhat it meant by this we found out only when a team of scientists researching Tyranid intergalactic travel methods discovered a discrepancy in our astronomical database. While charting the likely path the Tyranid had been following, they found that a small spiral galaxy some 30 million light-years distant from our own was... missing.\n\nThe galaxy, discovered and studied during the early space era of our species, is simply no longer emanating any form of light observable by our instruments. This bizarre and unexpected discovery sent our scientists into a scramble to try and explain what could cause an entire galaxy to simply vanish from the sky.\n\nTwo explanations emerged: Either the stars of the galaxy simply went out, all at once, or there is something, something so vast as to eclipse an entire galaxy, blocking its light from reaching us. Both theories seem equally implausible, and many have simply decried them as ludicrous, preferring to think that the missing galaxy never existed at all, invented by some erroneous use of a primitive telescope. Nonetheless, a palpable sense of dread and foreboding surrounds the whole incident..."
 crisis.250.desc: "The Brood-Queen has spawned a new Tyranid fleet which has assumed orbit over [Root.Capital.GetName]. With the Queen under our control, the creatures are utterly loyal and will obey our every command."
 crisis.252.desc: "In the recent fleet engagement against the Tyranid in the [battle_system.GetName] system, our forces managed to capture some sort of egg that was being transported by one of their Queens. The egg hatched shortly afterwards, and a §HBrood-Queen§! emerged.\n\nThrough the use of neural transmitters, our scientists have managed to pacify the creature. It will now obey our commands as if they had been issued by the Tyranid hive mind itself. We could potentially use this Queen to grow a small Tyranid brood of our own."
 crisis.30.i: "What does 'Tyranid' mean?"
 crisis.51.desc: "Some kind of militant order dedicated towards fighting the Tyranid has surfaced in the galaxy. Their membership seems to be made up primarily of the dispossessed and downtrodden - refugees, war veterans and others who have lost everything to the onslaught of the Scourge.\n\nDespite this, their ramshackle fleets have somehow managed to win several engagements against Tyranid hunter-killer swarms. There are unconfirmed reports that their fleets include starships of unusual design..."
 crisis.52.2.a.response: "Many Sentinels have military backgrounds. We are survivors from a dozen different fleets that fought the Tyranid and lost. As Sentinels, we have learned from the mistakes of the past and work hard never to repeat them.\n\nAlso, I believe I mentioned that we recruit from all species in the galaxy. We count among our numbers a handful of scattered survivors from an ancient fallen empire that no longer maintains a presence in this galaxy. They have given us access to secret technology caches and mothballed warfleets."
 crisis.52.a.response: "Many Sentinels have military backgrounds. We are survivors from a dozen different fleets that fought the Tyranid and lost. As Sentinels, we have learned from the mistakes of the past and work hard never to repeat them.\n\nAlso, I believe I mentioned that we recruit from all species in the galaxy. This includes the elder races, such as the [sentinel_fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We have the support of several influential factions within the §H[sentinel_fallen_empire.GetName]§! who have no wish to see their galaxy devoured. They have donated both ships and resources to our cause."
 crisis.52.desc: "We are the Sentinels. Our order has sworn to halt the murderous rampage of the Tyranid no matter the cost. Where other empires crumble, we stand firm. Where they abandon their own to the Scourge, we give them the means to fight back.\n\nI am Grand Master Korgas, the first of our order. Do not be deceived by my appearance - Sentinels are recruited from all species in the galaxy, including yours. We ask only that your government keep up the fight against the Tyranid and support our Sentinels where possible."
 crisis.55.a: "What can you tell us about the Tyranid?"
 crisis.55.a.response: "Alas, we don't know as much as we would like, but they are clearly extragalactic in origin. It is possible that they have devoured dozens or even hundreds of other galaxies before they reached ours... or we could be the first victims beyond their own home galaxy.\n\nAfter they have finished consuming all non-Tyranid life on a planet, they terraform it into what can only be described as a twisted nightmare. These Infested Worlds are hostile to all other forms of life, and the only way to cleanse the infestation is to burn away the entire biosphere with intense orbital bombardment."
 crisis.55.desc_01: "Our galaxy is faced with two possible futures: either the Tyranid Scourge consumes all organic life and moves on, or they are destroyed to the last of their despicable kind."
 crisis.55.desc_05: "If you lack the means to fight the Scourge directly, you are more than welcome to donate resources to us. This will let us throw additional forces against the Tyranid invaders."
 crisis.71.desc: "The Sentinels have taken note of your valiant struggle against the Tyranid Scourge. Since the fleet commanders of the [Root.GetName] clearly know how to win battles, we would like to permanently transfer one of our battle fleets over to your control. We currently lack the manpower to effectively crew these vessels, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.\n\nYou must solemnly promise to only use these warships against the Scourge, however!"
 crisis.76.desc: "Against all odds, our galaxy has prevailed. The Tyranid have been vanquished. I feared this day would never come, but now that victory is here, one last task remains for me.\n\nAs the current Grand Master of the Sentinels, I hereby disband our order. Our sole purpose was to see to the defeat of the Scourge, and now that this has been accomplished, it is time for our members to go their separate ways. To prevent their misuse, our surviving battle fleets will be dismantled.\n\nMay the defeat of this intergalactic menace herald a new era of peace. This is Sentinel One, signing off."
 enclave.240.c: "The Tyranid Swarm"
 enclave.255.desc: "Tyranid fleets rely on slow moving projectiles and hosts of smaller ships to take down their foes. One option to fend them off is to use point defense, coupled with armor and improvements to your ship's hull resilience; another is to engage them at extreme range. With sufficiently powerful energy weapons, one might manage to destroy their fleets before they can even get in range."
