 START_SCREEN_IMPERIUM: "Many millennia ago, the great immortal §dGod-Emperor§! united the humanity, divided and depleted by the §W'Age of Strife'§!, into the §dImperium§!, a mighty state that spread its wings over the entire galaxy. But the §PHorus Heresy§! that began, struck a blow at the §dImperium§!, and the events of the following millennia increasingly undermined it, putting it to the brink of annihilation.\n\nIn the grim expanse of the galaxy, the §dImperium of Man§!, stands as the last bastion against encroaching darkness.

Now, as a leader, the mantle of this sacred duty, and the legacy of the Great Crusade, rest upon your shoulders. Will you rise to command the righteous armies of the §dImperium§!, or succumb to the myriad challenges that seek to extinguish the light of humanity?\n\n§WFor the Emperor and Mankind!§!"
