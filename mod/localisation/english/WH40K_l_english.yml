This colossus is a bastion against the myriad threats that lurk in the dark void, from alien civilizations to malevolent forces beyond comprehension. §dThe Imperium's§! domains span countless worlds, each bearing the weight of its own struggles and triumphs in the name of human ascension. Yet, amidst this colossal expanse, the §dImperium§! is a realm teetering on the edge of collapse, beset by internal strife, unending war, and the encroaching darkness of impending doom.

 personality_necron_desc: "The §GNecrons§! are an enigmatic xenos species, humanoid in form yet comprised of skeletal, robotic warriors. They have remained dormant in their stasis-tombs for over 60 million Terran years, but now, they are stirring, awakening from their long slumber. These soulless creations were once the loyal servants of the ancient C'tan, fearsome Star Gods of Aeldari legend. Led by powerful §GNecrons§! Overlords, they command awe-inspiring technology and possess an unwavering dedication to their logical, millennia-spanning objectives. This ancient empire spans the galaxy, and their goal is to reclaim their lost glory and establish dominion over the cosmos once more."
 personality_necron: "Soulless Machines (Ancient Purifier)"

These savage xenos, the Orks, hold sway over countless worlds, each one bearing witness to their unrelenting dominance. Some planets are entirely consumed by their brutal rule, while others are ensnared in perpetual warfare. On select worlds, they establish themselves as ruthless overlords, subjugating local populations to carry out their every command. To the Orks, there is but one rallying cry that echoes through the void: the relentless and thunderous Waaagh!"

 personality_tyranid_desc: "§VThe Tyranid§! Swarm, also known as the §VGreat Devourer§!, is an incomprehensible extragalactic menace driven by an insatiable hunger for life itself. This relentless hive mind deploys an endless variety of bioforms, ranging from the minuscule rippers to colossal Hive Ships, sweeping through galaxies and consuming entire worlds in their path. §VTyranid§! technology is entirely biologically engineered, and their ultimate objective is nothing short of cosmic assimilation of all life, as they seek to incorporate all genetic diversity into their ever-evolving Hive Mind. §VThe Tyranids§! pose a cosmic terror, an existential threat of cataclysmic proportions to all galactic life that knows no boundaries."
 personality_tyranid: "Devourer Swarm (Extragalactical Invaders)"

 START_SCREEN_TAU: "Welcome, §lShas'la§!, to the §lGreater Good§!. You stand at the forefront of the §lTau Empire§!, a beacon of unity and progress in a galaxy consumed by conflict. As a Commander, it is your duty to lead our forces to victory, spreading the ideals of the §lGreater Good§! to all who will listen.\n\nThe §lTau Empire§! is a testament to cooperation and advancement. Our Ethereals guide us, ensuring harmony and purpose in our every action. From the swift and deadly Stealthsuit teams to the powerful Battlesuits raining fire from above, our technology is unmatched.\n\nBut the galaxy is a treacherous place, filled with ancient hatreds and relentless foes. §dThe Imperium§! clings to its decaying dogma, the §WEldar§! dance on the precipice of extinction, and the §VTyranids§! threaten to consume all. We must be vigilant, for the §lGreater Good§! is not easily won.\n\nAs you embark on your journey, remember our guiding principle: Unity, Purpose, and Progress. Together, we shall forge a brighter future for the galaxy, one world at a time."
 START_SCREEN_ELDAR: "In the waning days of a decaying galaxy, the §WEldar§! are a dwindling race, remnants of a once-mighty civilisation. Once rulers of an empire that spanned the stars, now we are but a shadow of our former glory, clinging to existence in the §WCraftworlds§! and hidden enclaves.\n\nWe are beings of grace and intellect, gifted with unparalleled psychic abilities. Our seers glimpse the skeins of fate, and our warriors dance through battle with the precision of a finely-tuned instrument. Each §WCraftworld§! is a bastion of our heritage, a self-sufficient worldship teeming with the last vestiges of our kind.\n\nYet the doom that befell our race looms ever closer. The malevolent forces of §PChaos§! seek to consume us, and the barbaric Orks and insidious §VTyranids§! threaten to overrun our sanctuaries. Even within our own ranks, dissent and ancient grudges stir.\n\nBut we are not without hope. From the darkest days, heroes rise. Our Farseers lead us with foresight, our Warlocks wield the raw power of the warp, and our Aspect Warriors embody the martial prowess of our people.\n\nIn the heart of the  §WCraftworlds§!, we forge our destiny. Through unity and determination, we seek to reclaim our rightful place among the stars. We are the §WEldar§!, ancient and proud, and our legacy shall endure, even in the face of impending doom."
 START_SCREEN_DARKELDAR: "Enter the shadows, denizen of the §MDark City§!. You are a scourge upon the galaxy, a servant of the §MDark Eldar§!, masters of pain and pleasure. In the twisted spires of Commorragh, power is everything, and survival is an art form.\n\n§MThe Dark Eldar§! are a society of eternal hedonism and cunning brutality. Ruled by the enigmatic Archons, we are the true masters of the webway, raiding across the galaxy to sate our unending thirst for suffering. From venomous blades to dark sorceries, our arsenal knows no limits.\n\nYet beware, for our existence is a perilous dance on the edge of oblivion. The vengeful §dImperium§! hunts us, the sinister forces of §PChaos§! seek to corrupt us, and even our own kind scheme for dominance. In Commorragh, betrayal is as common as desire.\n\nAs you navigate this treacherous realm, remember the fundamental rule of survival: strike hard and fast, for weakness is the path to annihilation. Embrace the exquisite agony of battle, and revel in the spoils of victory.\n\nIn the §MDark City§!, we are the predators, and the galaxy is our hunting ground. §MThe Dark Eldar§! know no mercy, and we shall carve our legend in the blood-soaked tapestry of the cosmos."
 START_SCREEN_TYRANID: "As the §VGreat Devourer§!, we are the ultimate force of nature, an incomprehensible swarm from beyond the galaxy. We exist only to consume, to adapt, and to evolve. Our insatiable hunger drives us to worlds across the cosmos, leaving naught but desolation in our wake.\n\nWe are the §VTyranids§!, a living apocalypse, a tide of ravenous bioforms drawn together by the will of the Hive Mind. From the smallest Ripper to the gargantuan Bio-Titans, every organism serves a singular purpose: to feed and to propagate.\n\nNo matter the defenses, no matter the sacrifices, we are relentless. Our bioweapons corrode steel, our synapse creatures orchestrate the battle, and our monstrous bioforms strike terror into the hearts of those who dare stand before us.\n\nThe Hive Fleets, colossal living organisms of incomprehensible scale, descend upon unsuspecting worlds like a cataclysmic storm. Our tendrils reach into the hearts of galaxies, driven by an inscrutable agenda that spans eons.\n\nThe galaxy trembles, for the §VTyranids§! know no cessation, no compromise. We are the inexorable force of evolution, and all life shall be consumed in our wake.\n\nPrepare, for the §VGreat Devourer§! approaches. Resistance is futile."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_NECRON_ORIGIN: "In the quiet slumber of time, an ancient and formidable race stirs once more. Entombed in stasis-crypts for millions of Terran years, they have awaited the mending of a galaxy scarred by eons of strife. After sixty million standard years of dormancy, a grand purpose unfurls. Upon desolate worlds, long thought barren, ancient machineries awaken, embarking on the solemn process of revitalization that will liberate those entombed within, granting them dominion over the celestial expanse once more. The inexorable, immortal legions of the §GNecrons§! are rising.\n\nFrom the humblest of soldiers to the most regal of lords, all §GNecrons§! are driven by a singular ultimate aim: to restore their ancient ruling dynasties to glory and reestablish dominion over the galaxy, as it once was in ancient days. This edict, etched into the very fabric of their consciousness, is unassailable. Yet, it is no trifling undertaking, for the §GNecrons§! are reawakening to a galaxy profoundly transformed.\n\nMany Tomb Worlds have vanished, obliterated by cosmic cataclysms or foreign invasions. Others stand wounded, their entombed hosts plagued by creeping madness or eroded to dust by the unyielding march of time. Degenerate alien species now squat amidst the ruins of those Tomb Worlds that endure, blissfully ignorant of the majesty they desecrate with their presumptuous presence.\n\nYet, in such ignorance, there lies no salvation. The undying have returned to reclaim their realm, and the living shall be swept aside."
 START_SCREEN_CHAOS: "From the roiling depths of the Warp, where chaos and madness reign, emerge the malevolent forces of §PChaos§!. They are the antithesis of order, a seething maelstrom of dark energies that seeks to consume the galaxy in an unending tide of madness and despair.\n\nThe §PChaos Gods§!, ancient and malevolent entities, each embodying a different aspect of chaos - §RKhorne, the Blood God§!; §BTzeentch, the Changer of Ways§!; §vNurgle, the Lord of Decay§!; and §_Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure§!. These deities vie for power, manipulating the fates of mortals and unleashing their daemonic legions upon the material realm.\n\nBound to the service of these capricious entities are the Traitor Legions, once loyal §WSpace Marine Chapters§! who turned against the §dImperium§! in pursuit of dark power. Led by their malevolent §PChaos Lords§!, they wage war across the galaxy, leaving worlds in ruins and souls corrupted.\n\nDaemons, twisted reflections of the §PChaos Gods§!' dark desires, spill forth from the Warp, wreaking havoc and spreading chaos wherever they tread. These nightmarish creatures are the embodiment of the Warp's malevolence, and they revel in the suffering of mortals.\n\nHeretics and cultists, drawn to the promises of power and freedom, worship the §PChaos Gods§! in secret, conducting blasphemous rituals and summoning forth daemonic entities to serve their twisted desires.\n\nThe §P$NAME_eyechaos$§!, a monstrous tear in the fabric of reality, serves as a festering heart of §PChaos§!, spewing forth daemonic hordes and corrupting all it touches.\n\nIn the name of the §PDark Gods, Chaos§! seeks to overthrow the shackles of order and plunge the galaxy into eternal turmoil. Their path is one of madness, treachery, and unbridled violence.\n\nBeware, for the forces of §PChaos§! are ever-watchful, and their insidious influence can corrupt even the strongest of wills. Will you embrace the power of the Dark Gods, or stand against the tide of eternal damnation?"
 START_SCREEN_CHAOS_UNDIVIDED: "The §PChaos Lords§! and §PDaemon Princes§! of §PChaos Undivided§! are at an advantage in their ability to unite any of the forces of §PChaos§! under their leadership. §dAbaddon the Despoiler, Warmaster of Chaos§!, leads the dreaded §dBlack Legion§!. Once known as the §dLuna Wolves§!, they were among the mightiest of the §dEmperor's Space Marine Legions§!. Now, they are united in their undying loyalty to §PChaos§!. With §dAbaddon's§! leadership, they launch Black Crusades, seeking to tear down the §dImperium's§! walls and herald an age of darkness.\n\nBound by a belief in the power of §PChaos§! as a whole, the followers of §dChaos Undivided§! draw strength from the dark energies of §RKhorne§!, §BTzeentch§!, §vNurgle§!, and §_Slaanesh§!. United in their pursuit of power, they balance on the edge of oblivion, seeking to dominate the galaxy through chaos and corruption.\n"

Driven by an insatiable thirst for battle and unyielding aggression, they carve their path through the stars, leaving a wake of destruction in their wake. The roar of chainswords and the scent of spilled blood are their hymns, and the skull throne of §RKhorne§! their ultimate goal.\n\nAmong them, the §P'World Eaters' Chaos Space Marines§!, once known as the §P'War Hounds'§!, embody §RKhorne's§! brutal nature.

Their Primarch, Mortarion, embodies the inexorable march of decay. The §P'Death Guard'§! march forth with bodies immune to pain, spreading contagion with every step. Their legacy is one of enduring resilience and acceptance of the inevitable decay of all things.\n\nWill you lead them to spread §vNurgle's§! embrace or face the inexorable advance of entropy?\n"

The 'Thousand Sons' wield formidable psychic powers, manipulating the fabric of reality itself. Their legacy is one of intellectual pursuit and mastery over the arcane.\n\nWill you lead them to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos or face the enigmatic whims of§BTzeentch's§! ever-changing designs?\n"
 START_SCREEN_CHAOS_SLAANESH: "Amidst the intoxicating symphony of pleasure and excess, the Slaaneshi revel in the pursuit of sensation and ecstasy. They are devoted followers of §_Slaanesh§!, the Chaos God of pleasure and indulgence, and they seek to push the boundaries of sensation to ever greater heights.

The 'Emperor's Children' revel in the pursuit of perfection, driven by the insatiable desire for ever greater heights of sensation.
